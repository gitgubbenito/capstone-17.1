**On this notebook:**
# I am trying to predict customer response (e.g., 'yes' or 'no' to a marketing offer) using ML predicting model
# I explored data visualization to understand relationships between features like age, job, balance, and the target variable 'y'.
# I compared the performance of four machine learning models: KNeighborsClassifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree.
# GridSearchCV was used for hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model for the 'roc_auc' metric.
# Confusion matrices were generated to visualize the performance of each model in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
# A precision-recall curve was plotted to compare the trade-off between precision and recall for the different models.
# - Certain features (e.g., balance, age) might have predictive power for the target variable.
# - The choice of model and hyperparameters significantly impacts performance.

**Precision and Recall Analysis**

Model - Precision (%) - Recall (%) </BR>

Logistic Regression - 67 - 49 </BR>
SVC - 63 - 56 </BR>
Decision Tree - 64 - 54 </BR>

Precision and Recall Analysis
# Model - 	Precision (%)	- Recall (%)
# 
# KNN	           - 73 -	          41 <br>
# Logistic
# Regression	   -  67	    -       49<br>
# SVC	           -  63	          - 56 <br>
# Decision Tree	 - 64	          - 54

# 
# 1. Model Comparison:
# - KNeighborsClassifier achieved the highest precision (73%) but the lowest recall (41%).
# - Logistic Regression had a balanced performance with a precision of 67% and a recall of 49%.
# - Support Vector Machine (SVC) had a slightly lower precision (63%) but a higher recall (56%).
# - Decision Tree also had a similar performance with a precision of 64% and a recall of 54%.

# 2. Precision-Recall Tradeoff:
# - The precision-recall curve visualizes the tradeoff between precision and recall for different thresholds.
# - Each model's curve shows how its precision and recall change as the threshold for classifying instances as "yes" is varied.

# 3. Model Selection:
# - KNeighborsClassifier might be preferred despite its lower recall.
# - Use Logistic Regression or SVC could be good choices If a balance between precision and recall is desired
# - If high recall is more important, SVC or Decision Tree might be more appropriate.

# 4. Further Analysis:
# - Additional metrics like F1 score, ROC AUC, and accuracy could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the models.
# - Tuning hyperparameters for each model might further improve their performance.
# - Considering the specific context and data characteristics is essential for selecting the best model for the problem at hand.
